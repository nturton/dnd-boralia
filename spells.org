  and cling like biting vines.

  "Snow's got claws, and she don’t let go!"

  "Dance in frost, bleed like spring sap!"

  "Stick, sting, snap! Let the cold eat your ankles!"

  "This ice remembers where you stepped—now it bites back!"

You can choose to ignore magic you’re fully aware of, such as the
magic items and ongoing spells of you and your allies.
You detect illusion magic only if that magic’s effect has a
lower rank than the rank of your detect magic spell. However,
items that have an illusion aura but aren’t deceptive in
appearance (such as an invisibility potion) typically are
detected normally.

**Heightened** (3rd) You learn the rank or level of the most powerful
magical effect the spell detects, as determined by the GM.
**Heightened** (4th) As 3rd rank, but you also pinpoint the source
of the highest-rank magic. Like for an imprecise sense, you

to within a 5-foot cube (or the nearest if larger than that).

  "Zzzap! That’s for touchin’ my friends!"

  "Little jolt for the legs, little kiss for the bones—hold still!"

aid in clotting and healing. This restorative substance can be used in
lieu of healer's tools for Medicine checks to Administer First Aid or
Treat Wounds. If the plaster isn't used within the spell's duration,
or if you Cast the Spell again before using the plaster, it reverts to
being normal non-magical earth.

one.

Make a spell attack roll against each target's AC. This deals 2d4
slashing damage. On a critical success, a target also takes 1d4

bleed damage.
