** Ancestry: Goblin
Attributes: +Dexterity, +Charisma, +Free, -Wisdom
Languages: Common, Goblin, +INT more from list.
Darkvision.
** Heritage: Irongut Goblin
You gain a +2 circumstance bonus to saving throws against afflictions,
against gaining the sickened condition, and to remove the sickened
condition. When you roll a success on a Fortitude save affected by
this bonus, you get a critical success instead. All these benefits
apply only when the affliction or condition resulted from something
you ingested.

You can eat and drink things when you are sickened.
** Ancestry feat: Junk Tinker
You can make useful tools out of even twisted or rusted scraps. When
using the Crafting skill to Craft, you can make level 0 items,
including weapons and armor, out of junk. This reduces the Price to
one-quarter the usual amount but always results in a shoddy
item. Shoddy items normally give a penalty, but you don't take this
penalty when using shoddy items you made (nor does the worse check
penalty of shoddy armor you made apply to you).

You can also incorporate junk to save money while you Craft any
item. This grants you a discount on the item as if you had spent 1
additional day working to reduce the cost, but the item is obviously
made of junk. At the GM's discretion, this might affect the item's
resale value depending on the buyer's tastes.

*** Cantrips
**** Stabilize

  “Hold still, hold still—death’s breath is near, but I’ll gum it
  shut.”

  Smears ash and spit across the wound in a strange pattern, chanting
  in a half-sung goblin dirge.

**** Healing Plaster

  “Bit of mud, dash of moss, and a slug’s blessing—hold this to your
  skin and groan a little.”

  Scoops mud from a pouch, slaps it on like ointment, muttering
  something about swamp mothers.

**** Rousing Splash

Casts Rousing Splash.
Range 60 feet; Targets 1 creature
You cause a splash of cold water to descend on
an ally's head, granting some temporary vigor. The target gains 1d4
temporary Hit Points, which last for 1 minute. The target is then
temporarily immune to the temporary Hit Points from rousing splash for
10 minutes. The target can also attempt an immediate flat check to
recover from a single source of persistent acid or fire damage, with
the DC reduction from appropriate assistance.

  “Wake up, twitchy! Here’s some river-ghost water to get your blood
  prickling!”

  Flings a rag dripping with herb-soaked water that sizzles like it’s
  alive.

**** Root Reading

  “Let’s see what the dirt remembers...”

  Crushes a root between her palms and sniffs the juice, eyes going
  milky as she listens to the earth.

**** Electric Arc (2A, 2d4 electric, 30 ft, 2 targets)

Casts Electirc Arc.
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 or 2 creatures
Defense basic Reflex
An arc of lightning leaps from one target to
another. Each target takes 2d4 electricity damage with a basic Reflex
save.

  “Spark-toothed sky bites again!”

  Claps her hands with a cackle, drawing lightning through the air like a crooked smile.

  "Crack-crack—sky bite's back!"

  "Here’s the storm-teeth, and they’re hungry!"

  "Zzzap! That’s for touchin’ my friends!"

  "Little jolt for the legs, little kiss for the bones—hold still!"

  "Borrowed this from a storm that died angry!"

  "Hear that buzz? That’s the sound of your luck runnin' off!"

**** Unprepared
***** Detect Magic
***** Caustic Blast: Fling a glob of acid that splashes a small area.
Traditions arcane, primal
Range 30 feet; Area 5-foot burst
Defense basic Reflex
You fling a large glob of acid that immediately detonates,
spraying nearby creatures. Creatures in the area take 1d8
acid damage with a basic Reflex save; on a critical failure, the
creature also takes 1 persistent acid damage.
***** Draw Moisture
***** Gouging Claw (2A, 2d6 slashing/piercing, 2 persistent bleed, touch)
***** Know the Way (Navigation)
*** Normal
Mystic Armor (2A, +1 AC, all day)

  “Coat yourself in ghost-skin and owl feathers—ain’t nothing sharp
  getting through that.”

  Snaps her fingers and coats herself in flickering frost-runes that
  vanish beneath the skin.

Heal

  “No, no, don’t go dying yet—I ain’t finished yelling at you.”

  Presses muddy fingers to a wound, a faint warmth pulsing out like
  breath through frost.

**** Unprepared
Fear
Goblin Pox
Gust of Wind
Mending
*** Focus cantrips
Clinging Ice

Casts Clinging Ice.
Range 30 feet; Targets 1 creature

Defense Reflex; Duration sustained up to 1 minuteFreezing sleet and
heavy snowfall collect on the target's feet and legs, dealing 1d4 cold
damage and other effects depending on its Reflex save.

Critical Success The target is unaffected.
Success The target takes half damage.
Failure The target takes full damage and a –5-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the spell ends.
Critical Failure The target takes double damage and a –10-foot circumstance penalty to its Speeds until the spell ends.

  “Freeze, twitchy thing! Let the snow choke your legs!”

  Points with a clawed finger; shards of dirty ice grow from nowhere
  and cling like biting vines.

  "Snow's got claws, and she don’t let go!"

  "Dance in frost, bleed like spring sap!"

  "Stick, sting, snap! Let the cold eat your ankles!"

  "This ice remembers where you stepped—now it bites back!"

  "Fall asleep, little beetle. Winter’s here to tuck you in."

  "Your feet don’t look busy—let’s fix that with a little freeze."

Phase Familiar

  “Talonface, don’t let the world hold you down—go ghosty for a bit.”

  Blows white powder into the air around her hawk, who flickers and
  vanishes with a shimmer like heat haze turned cold.

* Level 2
** Witch feat: Cauldron
*** Description (PC1 p.186)
You can brew magic in your cauldron, creating useful magical
concoctions. You can use the Craft activity to create oils and
potions. You immediately gain the formulas for four common 1st-level
oils or potions. At 4th level and every 2 levels beyond that, you gain
the formula for a common oil or potion of that level or lower (a
4th-level potion if you’re 4th level, a 6th-level potion if you’re 6th
level, and so on). If you have a familiar, you can have your familiar
learn these formulas rather than storing them in a formula book. Your
familiar can learn new formulas in the same way it learns new spells,
and these formulas are transferred from a slain familiar to a new
familiar in the same way spells are.

During your daily preparations, you can create one temporary oil or
potion using a formula you know. If you have master proficiency in
spell DC, you can create a batch of two temporary oils or potions
during your daily preparations, and if you have legendary proficiency,
you can create a batch of three. Any items you create this way become
inert bottles of liquid the next time you make your daily
preparations, and any remaining effects of the temporary items end. A
temporary oil or potion has no value.
*** Oils and potions
  4 common level 1 formulas:
  * Gecko potion
  * Nectar of purification
  * Potion of emergency escape
    Ration tonic
  * Healing potion 1d8 HP
    Oil of unlife
    Potion of retaliation
    Potion of shared memories
    Shielding salve
  
** Skill feat:
Assurance - Wait for level 3.
  Result is 10+(2+level)=14
Arcane Sense
Battle Medic
** 2 Spells
  Leaden steps
  Protector tree
* Plans
** Feat 3: Assurance.  Level 3 general feat.
This gives certain success when treating wounds.  Result is 10+2+3=15.
** Feat 2: Herbalist dedication. Level 4 witch feat.
*** Description (PC2 p.202)
You can create natural remedies.  You gain the advanced alchemy
benefits (page 174).  You can use advanced alchemy to create 4
alchemical consumables with the healing trait, though the number is
reduced by 2 if you didn’t make your daily preparations in the
wilderness. These consumables are called your herbal items. You
remember herbal item formulas and don’t need a formula book for them.

You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead
of Crafting to Craft alchemical consumables with the healing
trait. You don’t need to be trained in Crafting to do so, and you
can use healer’s tools instead of alchemist’s tools.

*** Items
Level 1, Antidote (lesser): +2 fort save against poison.
Level 1, Antiplague (lesser): +2 fort save against disease.
Level 1, Elixir of life (minor): +1d6 HP, +1 fort save against disease/poison.
Level 2, Bottled Catharsis (Minor): Counteract emotion effect.
Level 2, Surging Serum (Minor): Counteract clumsy/enfeebled.
Level 4, Bottled Catharsis (Lesser): Counteract emotion effect.
Level 4, Surging Serum (Lesser): Counteract clumsy/enfeebled.

*** Advanced alchemy benefits (PC2 p.174)
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t
already have it.  In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows
you to create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables each
day during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time
expenditure, as described on page 58. If you gain advanced alchemy
from more than one source, use the highest number of alchemical
consumables per day rather than adding them together, but you can make
items of any type allowed by any of your advanced alchemy
abilities. For instance, Herbalist Dedication lets you create 4
alchemical consumables with the healing trait, and Poisoner Dedication
lets you create four alchemical poison consumables. If you had both
feats, you could create 4 total consumables, but they could be any
combination of healing and poison items.
*** Alchemical Crafting
**** Description
You can use the Craft activity to create alchemical items.  When you
select this feat, you immediately add the formulas for four common
1st-level alchemical items to your formula book (page 288).
**** Items
Lesser Alchemist's fire: 1d8 fire +1 persistent +1 splash
Lesser Acid flask: 1d6 persistent acid + 1 acid splash
Lesser antidote: +2 item bonus to fortitude saves against poison
Lesser antiplague: +2 item bonus to fortitude saves against disease

* The Frostmourn idol
**** “The White God Who Sat Down and Froze”
They say... back in the plague times, when gods were rottin’ like old
turnips, there was one what didn’t run or scream. She just... sat down
in the snow. That’s all. Sat and waited. Didn’t say a word, didn’t
blink, just froze solid while the sky was screamin’. That’s what the
idol is, see? Her shape—carved by wind and frost and maybe goblins
with cold fingers. They say if you listen to it real careful, like
when you’re shiverin’ just before sleep, you can hear her
breathin’. Still waitin’. Maybe for someone clever. Or dumb.

**** Frostmourn and the Bone-Drinkers

Long time back, ‘fore my grandrat’s grandrat, there was a warren that
got too greedy. Dug deep, tried eatin’ the roots what don’t die in
winter. Started findin’ bones, still warm. Found the idol sittin’ in a
hole, wearin snow like a crown. First goblin that touched it turned to
ice. Second one turned to something else. But the third one? They say
she whispered to it... an’ it whispered back. That goblin led the
warren through a hundred winters, till the sun stopped risin’. Then
she walked into the snow and didn’t come back. That’s how it goes.

**** The Idol’s Teeth

They don’t tell you this in temples with fire and gold, but cold gods
bite hardest. That’s what the old crone said, before her tongue froze
to her own teeth. The idol? It don’t bless you. It don’t save you. It
remembers you. Like a wound. If you feed it warmth—blood, breath,
love, whatever—it keeps it. Stores it away in a little
frost-pocket. And maybe, one day, it gives it back. Or maybe it eats
you whole and spits out your bones, still smilin’.
