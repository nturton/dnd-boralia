*** Cantrips
Stabilize

  “Hold still, hold still—death’s breath is near, but I’ll gum it
  shut.”

  Smears ash and spit across the wound in a strange pattern, chanting
  in a half-sung goblin dirge.

Healing Plaster

  “Bit of mud, dash of moss, and a slug’s blessing—hold this to your
  skin and groan a little.”

  Scoops mud from a pouch, slaps it on like ointment, muttering
  something about swamp mothers.

Rousing Splash

  “Wake up, twitchy! Here’s some river-ghost water to get your blood
  prickling!”

  Flings a rag dripping with herb-soaked water that sizzles like it’s
  alive.

Root Reading

  “Let’s see what the dirt remembers...”

  Crushes a root between her palms and sniffs the juice, eyes going
  milky as she listens to the earth.

Electric Arc (2A, 2d4 electric, 30 ft, 2 targets)

  “Spark-toothed sky bites again!”

  Claps her hands with a cackle, drawing lightning through the air like a crooked smile.

  "Crack-crack—sky bite's back!"

  "Here’s the storm-teeth, and they’re hungry!"

  "Zzzap! That’s for touchin’ my friends!"

  "Little jolt for the legs, little kiss for the bones—hold still!"

  "Borrowed this from a storm that died angry!"

  "Hear that buzz? That’s the sound of your luck runnin' off!"

Mystic Armor (2A, +1 AC, all day)

  “Coat yourself in ghost-skin and owl feathers—ain’t nothing sharp
  getting through that.”

  Snaps her fingers and coats herself in flickering frost-runes that
  vanish beneath the skin.

Heal

  “No, no, don’t go dying yet—I ain’t finished yelling at you.”

  Presses muddy fingers to a wound, a faint warmth pulsing out like
  breath through frost.

**** Unprepared
Fear
Goblin Pox
Gust of Wind
Mending
*** Focus cantrips
Clinging Ice

  “Freeze, twitchy thing! Let the snow choke your legs!”

  Points with a clawed finger; shards of dirty ice grow from nowhere
  and cling like biting vines.

  "Snow's got claws, and she don’t let go!"

  "Dance in frost, bleed like spring sap!"

  "Stick, sting, snap! Let the cold eat your ankles!"

  "This ice remembers where you stepped—now it bites back!"

  "Fall asleep, little beetle. Winter’s here to tuck you in."

  "Your feet don’t look busy—let’s fix that with a little freeze."

Phase Familiar

  “Talonface, don’t let the world hold you down—go ghosty for a bit.”

  Blows white powder into the air around her hawk, who flickers and
  vanishes with a shimmer like heat haze turned cold.

*** The Frostmourn idol
**** “The White God Who Sat Down and Froze”
They say... back in the plague times, when gods were rottin’ like old
turnips, there was one what didn’t run or scream. She just... sat down
in the snow. That’s all. Sat and waited. Didn’t say a word, didn’t
blink, just froze solid while the sky was screamin’. That’s what the
idol is, see? Her shape—carved by wind and frost and maybe goblins
with cold fingers. They say if you listen to it real careful, like
when you’re shiverin’ just before sleep, you can hear her
breathin’. Still waitin’. Maybe for someone clever. Or dumb.

**** Frostmourn and the Bone-Drinkers

Long time back, ‘fore my grandrat’s grandrat, there was a warren that
got too greedy. Dug deep, tried eatin’ the roots what don’t die in
winter. Started findin’ bones, still warm. Found the idol sittin’ in a
hole, wearin snow like a crown. First goblin that touched it turned to
ice. Second one turned to something else. But the third one? They say
she whispered to it... an’ it whispered back. That goblin led the
warren through a hundred winters, till the sun stopped risin’. Then
she walked into the snow and didn’t come back. That’s how it goes.

**** The Idol’s Teeth

They don’t tell you this in temples with fire and gold, but cold gods
bite hardest. That’s what the old crone said, before her tongue froze
to her own teeth. The idol? It don’t bless you. It don’t save you. It
remembers you. Like a wound. If you feed it warmth—blood, breath,
love, whatever—it keeps it. Stores it away in a little
frost-pocket. And maybe, one day, it gives it back. Or maybe it eats
you whole and spits out your bones, still smilin’.
