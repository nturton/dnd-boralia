** Witch feat: Cauldron
*** Description (PC1 p.186)
You can brew magic in your cauldron, creating useful magical
concoctions. You can use the Craft activity to create oils and
potions. You immediately gain the formulas for four common 1st-level
oils or potions. At 4th level and every 2 levels beyond that, you gain
the formula for a common oil or potion of that level or lower (a
4th-level potion if you’re 4th level, a 6th-level potion if you’re 6th
level, and so on). If you have a familiar, you can have your familiar
learn these formulas rather than storing them in a formula book. Your
familiar can learn new formulas in the same way it learns new spells,
and these formulas are transferred from a slain familiar to a new
familiar in the same way spells are.

During your daily preparations, you can create one temporary oil or
potion using a formula you know. If you have master proficiency in
spell DC, you can create a batch of two temporary oils or potions
during your daily preparations, and if you have legendary proficiency,
you can create a batch of three. Any items you create this way become
inert bottles of liquid the next time you make your daily
preparations, and any remaining effects of the temporary items end. A
temporary oil or potion has no value.
*** Oils and potions
  4 common level 1 formulas:
  * Gecko potion
  * Nectar of purification
  * Potion of emergency escape
    Ration tonic
  * Healing potion 1d8 HP
    Oil of unlife
    Potion of retaliation
    Potion of shared memories
    Shielding salve

** Feat 2: Herbalist dedication. Level 4 witch feat.
*** Description (PC2 p.202)
You can create natural remedies.  You gain the advanced alchemy
benefits (page 174).  You can use advanced alchemy to create 4
alchemical consumables with the healing trait, though the number is
reduced by 2 if you didn’t make your daily preparations in the
wilderness. These consumables are called your herbal items. You
remember herbal item formulas and don’t need a formula book for them.

You become an expert in Nature and can use Nature instead
of Crafting to Craft alchemical consumables with the healing
trait. You don’t need to be trained in Crafting to do so, and you
can use healer’s tools instead of alchemist’s tools.

*** Items
Level 1, Antidote (lesser): +2 fort save against poison.
Level 1, Antiplague (lesser): +2 fort save against disease.
Level 1, Elixir of life (minor): +1d6 HP, +1 fort save against disease/poison.
Level 2, Bottled Catharsis (Minor): Counteract emotion effect.
Level 2, Surging Serum (Minor): Counteract clumsy/enfeebled.
Level 4, Bottled Catharsis (Lesser): Counteract emotion effect.
Level 4, Surging Serum (Lesser): Counteract clumsy/enfeebled.

*** Advanced alchemy benefits (PC2 p.174)
You gain the Alchemical Crafting feat (Player Core 252) if you don’t
already have it.  In addition, you gain advanced alchemy, which allows
you to create a certain number of infused alchemical consumables each
day during your daily preparations without the normal cost or time
expenditure, as described on page 58. If you gain advanced alchemy
from more than one source, use the highest number of alchemical
consumables per day rather than adding them together, but you can make
items of any type allowed by any of your advanced alchemy
abilities. For instance, Herbalist Dedication lets you create 4
alchemical consumables with the healing trait, and Poisoner Dedication
lets you create four alchemical poison consumables. If you had both
feats, you could create 4 total consumables, but they could be any
combination of healing and poison items.

* The Frostmourn idol
**** “The White God Who Sat Down and Froze”
They say... back in the plague times, when gods were rottin’ like old
turnips, there was one what didn’t run or scream. She just... sat down
in the snow. That’s all. Sat and waited. Didn’t say a word, didn’t
blink, just froze solid while the sky was screamin’. That’s what the
idol is, see? Her shape—carved by wind and frost and maybe goblins
with cold fingers. They say if you listen to it real careful, like
when you’re shiverin’ just before sleep, you can hear her
breathin’. Still waitin’. Maybe for someone clever. Or dumb.

**** Frostmourn and the Bone-Drinkers

Long time back, ‘fore my grandrat’s grandrat, there was a warren that
got too greedy. Dug deep, tried eatin’ the roots what don’t die in
winter. Started findin’ bones, still warm. Found the idol sittin’ in a
hole, wearin snow like a crown. First goblin that touched it turned to
ice. Second one turned to something else. But the third one? They say
she whispered to it... an’ it whispered back. That goblin led the
warren through a hundred winters, till the sun stopped risin’. Then
she walked into the snow and didn’t come back. That’s how it goes.

**** The Idol’s Teeth

They don’t tell you this in temples with fire and gold, but cold gods
bite hardest. That’s what the old crone said, before her tongue froze
to her own teeth. The idol? It don’t bless you. It don’t save you. It
remembers you. Like a wound. If you feed it warmth—blood, breath,
love, whatever—it keeps it. Stores it away in a little
frost-pocket. And maybe, one day, it gives it back. Or maybe it eats
you whole and spits out your bones, still smilin’.
